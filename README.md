# Image Processing Project â€“ Camera Pose Estimation  

This project explores **camera pose estimation** using **3D model rendering** and **deep learning**. The goal is to predict a cameraâ€™s orientation relative to a 3D object by training a CNN on synthetic images generated from multiple viewpoints.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

**General Description:**  
Developed a system that predicts camera pose from 2D images of a 3D object. The approach combines **synthetic dataset generation** (via 3D rendering) with a **convolutional neural network** trained to estimate viewing angles.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Synthetic Dataset Creation:** Generated labeled images from a 3D model (kidâ€™s slide) at different angles using PyVista & Open3D.  
- **CNN Model Training:** Implemented a Keras/TensorFlow CNN for pose classification.  
- **Evaluation:** Achieved **97% validation accuracy**; optimized dataset with denser viewpoints at edge/mid angles to reduce error.  
- **Angle Prediction:** Model outputs estimated camera angles for unseen images.  
- **Visualization:** Plotted training performance and error trends using Matplotlib.  

**Technologies:**  
`Python` Â· `TensorFlow/Keras` Â· `Open3D` Â· `PyVista` Â· `Matplotlib` Â· `PIL`
